# vetrinalive

A vetrinalive mobile app given to me by Lasting Dynamics Company as a test.

The application was built using  React Native, Native Base, React Native Navigations and other dependencies.

The app consists of 10 screens which are Login, Sign-up, Forget-Password, Dashboard, Products, New product, Orders, Single Order, Payments and Subscriptions Screens.

It made us of stack navigations to navigate across the login, sign-up and forget-password screens.

It also made use of Drawer navigation to showcase drawer for the rest screens.
